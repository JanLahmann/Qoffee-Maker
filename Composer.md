## IBM Quantum Composer

Using the IBM Quantum Composer, Quantum Circuits can be build by drag & drop of various gates onto the qubits. The resulting measurement probabilities are shown in a diagram. In addition, the Quantum Circuits can be executed on real quantum hardware or on simulators. A more detailed overview of the IBM Quantum Composer can be found [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/overview).

2 View: customize the layout.

4 Quantum gates and operations bar: Drag and drop gates (i.e. the building blocks of quantum circuits) onto the graphical circuit editor. The qubits are ordered q2, q1, q0, and each are initialized with 0.

6 Graphical circuit editor: this is where you build a circuit. Drag gates and other operations onto the horizontal qubit “wires” that make up your quantum register.

8 Visualizations: characterize your circuit, e.g. visualize the probabilities of the quantum state as you build it.
