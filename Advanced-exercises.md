## Advanced Exercises (optional)
To spice up your beverage selection, you can try to find quantum circuits that solve the following advanced exercises.

### I want an Espresso, but want to apply all single qubit gates to q0 only

To select an Espresso (2, 010), qubit q1 needs to be measured as "1". This can be achieved by using a swap gate, or three CNOT gates as shown in the following solution. (solutions are only provided for the first two of the advanced exercises).

### I want a normal coffee, but want to use only one single X-Gate (plus the other gates as needed)

To certainly get a normal coffee (3, 011), we need to switch the states of both q0 and q1 from 0 to 1. 
Instead of applying a second NOT gate, you can use the following circuit identity: NOT = H Z H with Z being the Z gate.

### I want a tea or something strong, but I prefer tea

Goal: Tea (0, 000) or Espresso (2, 010) or Coffee (3, 011) or Wiener Melange (6, 110) or Americano (7, 111), but Tea with a higher probability.

### I want something strong, but preferably an Espresso
Goal: Espresso (2, 010) or Wiener Melange (6, 110) or Americano (7, 111) with higher probability for an Espresso than for Wiener Melange and Americano.

### I want something with caffein

Goal: Espresso (2, 010) or Coffee (3, 011) or Cappuccino (4, 100) or Latte Macchiato (5, 101) or Wiener Melange (6, 110) or Americano (7, 111).

### I want either something without caffein or something with much caffein but without milk (CCX Gate)

Goal: Tea (0, 000) or Hot Chocolate (1, 001) or Espresso (2, 010) or Americano (7, 111).

### I want something to drink, it doesnâ€™t matter what, preferably a Coffee, but no Americano

Goal: Tea (0, 000) or Hot Chocolate (1, 001) or Espresso (2, 010) or Coffee (3, 011) or Cappuccino (4, 100) or Latte Macchiato (5, 101) or Wiener Melange (6, 110), Coffee should have the highest probability.
