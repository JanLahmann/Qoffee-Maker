# Welcome to the Qoffee Maker

## Introduction
Qoffee Maker is based on [Quantum Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) and will produce a coffee, capuccino, etc based on the measurement result of a Quantum Circuit. All you need to do to get your favourite type of coffee is to graphically create a quantum circuit whose measurement result is the binary number of your beverage.

Sounds complicated? ... Actually it's quite simple. Have at look at the instruction and the examples.
You can try ouut the examples on the [IBM Quantum Composer](http://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer), before running it on the real Qoffee Maker.
